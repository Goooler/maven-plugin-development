This plugin aims to fill the tiny gap for people who need to create an https://maven.apacke.org[Apache Maven] plugin from a Gradle build.
To do this the plugin wraps around the https://maven.apache.org/plugin-tools/[Maven Plugin Tools API] and feeds it with the right inputs from the Gradle build.

Compatible with Gradle 7.5 or later.

== Features

- Automatic generation of a maven plugin descriptor containing all mojos in the selected source set (by default the plugin looks for mojo implementations in the main source set)
- Support for annotation and JavaDoc tag based mojo implementations
- Optional generation of a help mojo implementation
